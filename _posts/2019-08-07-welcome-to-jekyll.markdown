I'm really inspired by comments in [Hacker News][hn]. I'm not an expert at all with two years experience in part-time freelancing.

My early blog is [Wordpress][wp]. It mainly wrote somewhat about Linux. I decided to switch to github pages as it gave me flexibility over the Wordpres platform, I hope so.

I'm going to post once or twice every two weeks.

For now, I wish blogging could teach me how to think better, write better, teach better.
